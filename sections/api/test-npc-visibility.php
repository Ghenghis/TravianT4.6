 * Test Script: NPC Visibility in Travian Game
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that NPC actions appear in Travian reports and statistics
 * 
 * Tests:
 * 1. NPC villages appear in rankings
 * 2. NPC attacks generate reports
 * 3. Statistics include NPC actions
 * 4. Game engine recognizes NPCs
 * 5. NPC players visible in player lists
 * 
 * Usage: php test-npc-visibility.php [worldId]
