 * Test Script: NPC Troop Training with Travian
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that NPCs can train troops using Travian troop system
 * 
 * Tests:
 * 1. Troop type IDs match Travian standards
 * 2. Training costs calculated correctly
 * 3. Resources deducted properly
 * 4. Training queue functional
 * 5. Building requirements checked
 * 
 * Usage: php test-npc-training.php [villageId]
