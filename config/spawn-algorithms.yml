# Spawn Placement Algorithms Configuration
version: 1.0

algorithms:
  quadrant_balanced:
    name: Quadrant Balanced Distribution
    description: Evenly distributes NPCs across 4 map quadrants (NW, NE, SW, SE)
    parameters:
      ensure_equal_distribution: true
      quadrant_tolerance: 5       # Allow Â±5% variance per quadrant
      min_distance_between_npcs: 5  # Minimum 5 tiles apart
    use_cases:
      - Balanced PvP gameplay
      - Fair starting positions
      - Standard world setup
    
  random_scatter:
    name: Random Scatter Distribution
    description: Randomly places NPCs across the entire map
    parameters:
      avoid_center: true
      center_exclusion_radius: 50
      randomness_factor: 1.0      # Full randomness
      min_distance_between_npcs: 3
    use_cases:
      - Chaotic gameplay
      - Unpredictable spawns
      - Artifact-like appearance
    
  kingdom_clustering:
    name: Kingdom Clustering Distribution
    description: Groups NPCs into clusters simulating kingdoms/alliances
    parameters:
      cluster_size: 15            # NPCs per cluster
      cluster_radius: 25          # Tiles around cluster center
      min_cluster_distance: 100   # Distance between clusters
      cluster_variance: 0.3       # 30% size variance
      quadrant_balance: true      # Distribute clusters across quadrants
    use_cases:
      - Alliance-focused gameplay
      - Territorial warfare
      - Realistic kingdom formation

# Default Settings
defaults:
  algorithm: quadrant_balanced
  collision_detection: true
  max_spawn_attempts: 50        # Retry up to 50 times if collision
  fallback_algorithm: random_scatter
