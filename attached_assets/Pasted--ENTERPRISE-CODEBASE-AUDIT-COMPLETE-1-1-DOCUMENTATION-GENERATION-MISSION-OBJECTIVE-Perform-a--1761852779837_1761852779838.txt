# ENTERPRISE CODEBASE AUDIT - COMPLETE 1:1 DOCUMENTATION GENERATION

## MISSION OBJECTIVE
Perform a comprehensive, multi-pass audit of the entire codebase to generate 
production-ready, enterprise-grade documentation with 100% accuracy. Every file, 
every function, every dependency must be documented with diagrams and actionable plans.

## SCANNING METHODOLOGY

### PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & INVENTORY (Pass 1)
**Objective**: Catalog every artifact in the codebase

1. **File System Traversal**:
   - Scan ALL directories recursively
   - List every file with: path, size, last modified, language
   - Identify file relationships (imports, dependencies, configs)
   - Count total: files, lines of code, directories
   - Detect orphaned files (not imported/referenced anywhere)

2. **Technology Stack Mapping**:
   - Languages & versions used
   - Frameworks & their versions
   - Package managers & dependency trees
   - Database systems & ORM layers
   - External APIs & integrations
   - Infrastructure components (Docker, K8s, etc.)

3. **Architecture Discovery**:
   - Entry points (main files, endpoints)
   - Module boundaries & responsibilities
   - Data flow paths (request → response)
   - State management patterns
   - Authentication/authorization flows
   - Background job/worker systems

**OUTPUT REQUIRED**:
- `01-PROJECT-INVENTORY.md` (complete file tree with metadata)
- `02-TECH-STACK-MATRIX.md` (all dependencies with versions)
