                               the border. His troop count increased 40% this week. 
                               Recommend we coordinate defense."
```

### **As Your Ally:**
```
[Alliance Chat]
AI_Diplomat_077: "@everyone War planning meeting in 30 mins. 
                  Target: Red Alliance (rank #2).
                  I've coordinated 12 members for simultaneous attack.
                  Check your assigned targets in alliance forum."

                  to top 5 attackers. Let's crush them! üí™"
```

### **As Your Enemy:**
```
[Private Message from AI_Assassin_019]
"Nice village you have there at (125, -87). 
 Would be a shame if something happened to it... 
 
 I propose a deal: 5k wheat/day tribute and I 
 focus my attention... elsewhere. 
 
 What do you say? You have 24 hours to decide."
```

python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
    --model ./models/mistral-7b-instruct \
    --port 8000
```

**Step 3: Launch NPCs** (5 mins)
```bash
python npcs/npc_manager.py  # Creates 50 NPCs
