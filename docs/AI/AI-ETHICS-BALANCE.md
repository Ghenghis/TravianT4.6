# AI Ethics & Game Balance - Fair Gameplay Framework

## üéØ Overview

**Current Weakness**: No safeguards against AI domination, unfair advantages, or exploits.

**Solution**: Implement comprehensive fairness systems, anti-exploit measures, and difficulty balancing to ensure fun gameplay.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fairness Principles

### **Core Rules**

1. **NPCs must be challenging, not unbeatable**
2. **Human players should feel accomplishment when winning**
3. **AI advantages must be transparent**
4. **Exploits must be prevented**
5. **Game remains fun for solo players**
